This website <span style="color:red;">was made</span><span style="color:green;">started</span> as a <span style="color:red;">result of</span><span style="color:green;">way to share our early research regarding</span> the COVID-19 <span style="color:red;">pandemic, but much of the advice may be applicable in other situations.</span><span style="color:green;">pandemic. We were trying to write down for ourselves and our friends what to do when so many people were going to get sick.</span> Much of what's discussed here may be common sense to some, but we felt it's still good to have some checklists and advice for various stages of illness in one place. <span style="color:red;">While we</span><span style="color:green;">We</span> consulted with nurses and <span style="color:red;">doctors on much of this advice, most of</span><span style="color:green;">doctors, but</span> this <span style="color:red;">text</span><span style="color:green;">site</span> was <span style="color:red;">written</span><span style="color:green;">created</span> by the non-medically trained, trying to puzzle together what makes sense in <span style="color:red;">this</span><span style="color:green;">our</span> new <span style="color:red;">situation.</span><span style="color:green;">normal. </span>

As we started writing for this site in Berlin, Germany in the second week of March 2020, much about the virus was still unclear, but numbers of infected and dead were rising steadily, most recently in Italy. <span style="color:red;">While it is not now - nor is it ever - a good time to panic, we do think it</span><span style="color:green;">Whether the virus has caused total crisis where you are or not: It</span> is<span style="color:red;">now</span> time to think and prepare.

This guide is based on the assumption that in the coming months, more people than usual will either become ill or have ill people in their lives. Let's all hope for the best, but we're going to assume that doctors and hospitals are going to be very busy if not overloaded. We have to confront the possibility that some of the people who would normally be cared for under medical supervision might need to be cared for at home. We hope some of the information here will give you some confidence in dealing with this disease, which in and by itself will reduce the load on doctors and nurses who, from the looks of it, will be quite busy in weeks and months to come. At the same time, we hope to give you information that helps you tell when it is time to get professional medical help. Getting large amounts of people to get that balance right may make all the difference in the time to come.

<span style="color:green;">### What this</span> guide <span style="color:red;">contains general advice that should be applicable in many places.</span><span style="color:green;">is not...</span>

We <span style="color:red;">may add</span><span style="color:green;">try to provide a large amount of *general* helpful tips for dealing with COVID-19 during the various stages in which it might affect your household. **What we cannot do is provide up-to-date</span> information that is specific to <span style="color:red;">certain countries or regions, but</span><span style="color:green;">where</span> you <span style="color:red;">should keep your eyes open for more specific</span><span style="color:green;">are.** We will try to tell you when we think you need to seek up-to-date local</span> information <span style="color:green;">in text boxes such as this.</span>

<span style="color:green;">Note that any advice</span> from <span style="color:red;">other credible</span><span style="color:green;">official</span> sources <span style="color:red;">that</span><span style="color:green;">you may find could be outdated as soon as a few days after it</span> is <span style="color:red;">more local</span><span style="color:green;">issued, so always try to find the latest guidance and advice you can. Refer</span> to <span style="color:green;">local broadcast media and **trusted** information on the internet. Your local health authorities know the situation on the ground</span> where you <span style="color:red;">are.</span><span style="color:green;">are, and should be talking to the public through the media.</span>

<span style="color:green;">That said, we are seeing various levels of quality in official response. Sometimes there will insufficient capacity to supply everyone with individual help and advice, for example because hotlines and testing centers are overloaded. **Help may well be unavailable at some times**. In this text we will just keep going, giving you the best advice we found in our research. This doesn't mean we think such general advice as is on this site could be better than local help from trained professionals. Treat the advanced chapters of this website as a last resort: much better than nothing, but by all means get local help from actual professionals if you can.</span>

<span style="color:green;">Also note that **we do not sugar-coat**. This site is written by and for adults who can handle thinking through the consequences of our current global predicament. There is no reason to panic, but the situation is serious enough that we feel everyone should have access to the best information we could find. </span>

### Know the Facts: 

* COVID-19 is real. 
* Itâ€™s a disease caused by the <span style="color:green;">new</span> SARS-CoV-2 virus that mutated to infect human hosts after starting in animals.
* <span style="color:red;">It</span><span style="color:green;">COVID-19 is dangerous. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  * The virus that causes it</span> seems to <span style="color:red;">be about twice as infectious and</span><span style="color:green;">spread far [more readily than SARS](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00660-x). </span>
<span style="color:green;">  * It seems</span> to <span style="color:green;">commonly</span> cause <span style="color:green;">pneumonia, while most cases of the seasonal influenza virus (flu) [do not](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumonia/what-is-the-connection) (and those that do are more dangerous). COVID-19 is also associated with</span> far more <span style="color:red;">pneumonia, other</span><span style="color:green;">other,</span> serious <span style="color:red;">disease</span><span style="color:green;">complications requiring medical care, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac events (especially in people with existing heart disease), respiratory failure, septic shock, liver injury, and multi-organ failure. It seems to cause [over 3x](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020)</span> and <span style="color:red;">deaths</span><span style="color:green;">possibly [10x more deaths](https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idOVC4M5QSF)</span> than the <span style="color:red;">seasonal influenza virus (flu).</span><span style="color:green;">flu. (But until testing is much more widespread, it will be impossible to know for sure.) </span>
<span style="color:green;">  * Unlike the flu and other diseases, there are currently no known vaccines or anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 supported by sufficient scientific evidence from double-blind, randomized controlled trials. (Though you can be sure research is ongoing worldwide!) </span>
<span style="color:green;">  *</span> It's also worse than the flu because the world population so far lacks immunity. New <span style="color:red;">diseases</span><span style="color:green;">pathogens</span> are more <span style="color:green;">potentially</span> dangerous, because their infection rates can grow incredibly rapidly (even having <span style="color:red;">exponential growth).</span><span style="color:green;">[exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O133ppiVnWY)).</span> Such rapid transmission of a new <span style="color:green;">pathogen that commonly causes</span> disease <span style="color:green;">severe enough to require medical care</span> can swiftly overwhelm even <span style="color:red;">outstanding health-care</span><span style="color:green;">the world's best healthcare</span> systems, making it impossible for everyone who needs care <span style="color:green;">(including for unrelated conditions)</span> to access it <span style="color:red;">-</span><span style="color:green;">--</span> and in turn contributing to <span style="color:green;">even</span> more severe disease and <span style="color:red;">death.</span><span style="color:green;">more, otherwise avoidable deaths.</span> 
* <span style="color:red;">Containment</span><span style="color:green;">Slowing the spread</span> of COVID-19 <span style="color:green;">down (also known as mitigation)</span> is the best chance we <span style="color:green;">still</span> have to save a large number of <span style="color:red;">lives. Containment</span><span style="color:green;">lives.{{site.data.tags.footnote.begin}}You may have also heard mitigation or slowing the spread called &quot;flattening the curve.&quot; But that phrase now usually refers to slowing the pace of new cases requiring medical care so that they stay [within the capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html) of the medical system. Critics argue we would have to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; for [more than a decade](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727) in order to achieve that â€” which seems impossible due to characteristics of the virus like its transmissibility. So what we really want, they argue, is to use mitigation to get back to containment â€” ultimately stopping rather than just slowing the spread. &lt;br&gt; But there's not currently a scientific consensus on whether that is possible, because this is a fast-evolving situation involving a new pathogen, and we do not know enough yet about its [infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145768). However, there is broad (but not universal) agreement among leading epidemiologists and other relevant experts that mitigation will still be effective in decreasing needless suffering and deaths, in part by flattening the curve enough to [buy us time](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) to better prepare -- making more respirators / masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and retrained medical professionals, and maybe even treatments or vaccines for the disease. &lt;br&gt;Anyway, due to this controversy, we avoid using the phrase &quot;flatten the curve&quot; in the text because to most people now, it means slowing disease spread enough to keep it within medical systems' capacities (impossible) rather than slowing it to stop it (maybe possible) â€” or slowing it just to decrease the damage it does (definitely possible).{{site.data.tags.footnote.end}} Slowing the spread down</span> requires widespread cooperation with and implementation of measures like <span style="color:green;">reporting your symptoms to the authorities where required,</span> accessible <span style="color:red;">testing</span><span style="color:green;">testing, isolation of the sick and those exposed to them,</span> and social distancing <span style="color:green;">-- sometimes even rising to the level of mandatory sheltering in place -- for everyone else</span> (see Level 1 below).  
* For these reasons, <span style="color:red;">it is time now</span><span style="color:green;">many have changed or will soon need</span> to change <span style="color:red;">our</span><span style="color:green;">their</span> way of life<span style="color:red;">(for now)</span> to address the very real threat this pandemic poses to <span style="color:red;">our world.</span><span style="color:green;">everyone on Planet Earth.</span> 

Remember that there is no difference in potential infectiousness between friends and strangers. There is no race, ethnic group, or nationality that is innately more likely to get or transmit the virus than another. Try to help others when you can without being in <span style="color:red;">contact with large groups of people unnecessarily. There are obvious trade-offs here that everyone has to weigh for themselves. Some people will need to have more</span><span style="color:green;">physical</span> contact with other people <span style="color:red;">than others.</span><span style="color:green;">unnecessarily: A lot will depend on whether the social fabric of our society holds.</span> Slowing the spread <span style="color:green;">of an infectious disease</span> is <span style="color:red;">never absolute, but</span><span style="color:green;">rarely absolute. But taken</span> over <span style="color:red;">all of society,</span><span style="color:green;">society as a whole,</span> our efforts still work when everyone does what they can, within their limits.
