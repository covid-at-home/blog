## Shopping list

<span style="color:red;">In addition</span><span style="color:green;">The standard advice is</span> to <span style="color:red;">having approximately</span><span style="color:green;">have about</span> 2-4 weeks of essentials like groceries and other household <span style="color:red;">supplies,</span><span style="color:green;">supplies. Let's unpack that a bit. </span>

<span style="color:green;">### Food</span>

<span style="color:green;">What this really means for most people now is ideally to buy fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, and cheese once a week. You would preferably do this online and have it delivered to protect yourself and others by staying at home. Alternately, you might go shopping once a week in person, wearing a mask and gloves, early on when there tends to be less traffic in grocery stores. At the same time, you might stock up on a few weeks' worth of fresh things that will keep longer than a week (garlic and onions, potatoes and sweet potatoes, citrus fruit and apples, and some cheeses, processed breads, and meats). And if you are able, you might stock up even more on a few weeks' worth of canned, jarred, frozen, and otherwise shelf-stable, healthy foods that you like. Try to keep it real â€” whole food ingredients when you can't stick with whole foods. That means looking for food products with no added sugar, salt, and unpronounceable additives. There are already a lot of great lists out there on cooking in quarantine, but here are a few basics, tips, and suggestions: </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **Produce**. Canned, jarred, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables can have even more nutrition than fresh, when they are frozen (or whatever) shortly after harvest. There is a vast array of available shelf-stable produce. Here are some examples of things you may or may not like, and ideas of things to make with them... </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Condiments. Canned olives, Greek peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and sauerkraut can be used to flavor rice, pasta, and salads. Tomato paste on toast with leftover veggies, dried herbs, and cheese can make a nice impromptu pizza. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Jarred and canned fruits and vegetables. From pumpkin pie filling made with canned pumpkin to pink lemonade made with jarred, mashed cherries -- or just plain peas and carrots from a can, mixed with rice -- there are a lot of flavor, texture, and color variations to be discovered here. Canned applesauce with a sprinkling of cinnamon is a kid-friendly classic. Vegetable soups with real veggies and tomato sauce that is, well, essentially just tomatoes are also good options. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Dried fruit. Dates, figs, raisins, cranberries, cherries, apricots... The list goes on. Dried fruit can sweeten up salads, corn flakes, and porridge, or give you a quick handful of healthy calories right when you need it. </span>
<span style="color:green;">   - Bulk. Frozen broccoli and cauliflower can be steamed, chopped, and added to rice or pasta to build more fiber and water (not to mention color and flavor) into your meal. </span>
<span style="color:green;">   - Sorbets and smoothies. If you have a blender, frozen fruit with a little tea and honey makes nice, easy sorbets. Frozen fruit with yogurt and milk or kefir makes simple smoothies. </span>
<span style="color:green;">   - **Carbohydrates**. Pasta and rice, oatmeal and other porridges, and flours tend to be extremely shelf-stable and versatile as the basis of meals. You probably want to vary them to keep your diet diverse, to avoid nutritional deficiencies and boredom -- and to vary the effort level required of you in cooking. (Baking your own bread or brownies using those flours will probably take considerably more work than, say, microwaving a packet of two-minute rice and throwing some olives and cheese on top.) </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **Protein**. While protein comes in many flavors, it's probably a good idea to think about adding umami (meaty / hearty) tastes to your quarantine pantry with protein. Some of these tastes are vegan (think smoked almonds or nutritional yeast), while others are not. Give yourself as much variety in healthy foods as you can and desire, to support your immune system -- and your psychological well-being -- in this difficult time. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Go nuts. Now is a good time to increase your intake of nuts, an excellent source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. A handful of different types of nuts (cashews, sliced almonds, sunflower seeds...) can add a lot of texture and flavor to a simple salad. Nut butters are also nutritious, but are an easier way to pack on the pounds since it's easier to eat a lot more calories more quickly that way. Slather a bit on apples slices or celery sticks to increase the feeling of fullness. Cashews can be added to soups (to be blended) for additional creaminess. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Nutritional yeast is another good vegan source of protein. It can be baked onto green chips (spinach, kale) or other veggies in for an oven roast (potatoes, eggplant), or added to soup, mash, or dip for a cheesy flavor. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Beans, beans, they're good for your heart... Some people say you should always make your own from dried beans, because it's cheaper than using the canned preparations, with or without added sauces. Others say you should have both types, since &quot;fast food&quot; is sometimes what you want. Still others say, if you're going to eat those beans, you need to find your own apartment...   </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Tofu and eggs tend to keep a long time, especially with proper refrigeration, but check yours for dates. Smoked tofu can be diced to add flavor and protein to salads. Plain tofu can be pan-seared and added to rice along with spices, vegetables, and condiments, or an easy jar of curry sauce. Eggs can be hard-boiled and eaten plain, sliced on salads or over soup or rice, or mixed with mayo, mustard, and spices (paprika, cayenne, pepper) for egg salad. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Canned fish is another good source of protein and healthy fats, although weekly intake should be limited depending on the type due to concerns about mercury content. Sardines and anchovies are some of the safest from this standpoint as they are smaller fish, and so have less opportunity to accumulate heavy metal pollution from other points in the food chain. They can be added straight on toast with a little vinegar. Tinned sardines and mayonnaise can be used to make a hearty dip for crackers. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Longlife (also known as ultra-pasteurized or ultra heat treated) milk. Vegan milks also tend to be longlife, but dairy milk offers more complete nutrition. </span>
<span style="color:green;">   - **Other shelf-stable flavorings, fats, and comfort foods**. If you don't already, it's a good idea to have some vinegar (balsalmic, red wine), miso paste, soy/tamari sauce, and other basic spices (iodized salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, thyme, oregano, basil, cinnamon, sugar / sweetener of your choice) to experiment with cooking differently during this different time. Fats other than butter tend to already be shelf-stable -- olive oil is a common favorite for its heart-healthy properties as well as its taste. While now is not a time to binge on ultra-processed foods, nor is it a time to push yourself to give up that cup of coffee or bite of chocolate that makes you happy. If you can hide away a jar of cherry preserves, Nutella, or whatever else your weakness is -- for &quot;emergencies&quot; -- there's nothing like gooey gourmet toast to soothe whatever ails you that can be treated without professional medical assistance. </span>
<span style="color:green;">   </span>
<span style="color:green;">### Household essentials</span>

<span style="color:green;">Everyone and their brother has already thought to stock up on toilet paper, infamously leading to shortages and even social unrest (from organized crime to public brawling) in various places worldwide. Don't be that person. Maybe when it comes to things that you know may be in short supply solely because of panic buying (like toilet paper), only buy a little bit every week. Share with your neighbors if you have it and they don't. Things will be crazy throughout this crisis from time to time, but people all over the world are using the opportunity to ask the people around them what they need -- and that kind of kindness builds the strength and resilience that we all need to get through this thing together. </span>

<span style="color:green;">That said, it probably makes sense to have a back-up of your regular household essentials. That means different things to different people, but common items include laundry detergent, dish soap, shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, moisturizer, toothpaste, floss, paper towels, and condoms. </span>

<span style="color:green;">### Other supplies</span>

<span style="color:green;">In addition to having approximately 2-4 weeks of essentials,</span> here are some necessary and handy things to have if you are going to be taking care of someone with COVID-19. None of this is very expensive or requires special training to use. 

If we included examples (generally on the German version of Amazon), this is not a buying recommendation and we are not making any money if you click that precise one (or any other). By showing you the example, we mean nothing more than *&quot;something like this.&quot;* Use whatever online or retail channel you like to get something similar. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Must have

* **Fever thermometer** (2-10 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001NYHXYS))

   <span style="color:red;">&gt;![](/images/thermometer.png)</span><span style="color:green;">&gt; ![](/images/thermometer.png)</span>
   &gt; 
   &gt; So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks, they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted <span style="color:red;">anally</span><span style="color:green;">in the bottom</span> to get a more precise measurement, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   &gt; Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: Once people get sick, you want to change the bed linens often, and you may use more towels also.
   
* **Cleaning <span style="color:red;">supplies, bleach**</span><span style="color:green;">supplies**</span>

<span style="color:green;">   &gt; Disposable paper towels and spray glass cleaner or really any other type of cleaner that cuts oil (dish soapy water, shower cleaner, diluted bleach) should kill the virus by dissolving its lipid (fat) membrane and thus rendering it inactive, while containing the contaminated cleaning materials safely inside your garbage bag. Here's a fuller [list](https://www.consumerreports.org/cleaning/common-household-products-that-can-destroy-novel-coronavirus/).</span> 

* **Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, Tylenol or Panadol)**

  &gt; The fever supressant and painkiller of choice. Make sure you follow the packaging instructions and <span style="color:red;">do not exceed</span><span style="color:green;">stay within</span> the maximum recommended daily dose. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Nice to have

* **Pulse oxymeter** (20-25 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P3ZS6L3))  **See note below!**
   &gt; ![](/images/pulse-oxi.png)
   &gt;
   &gt; Little gadget that clips on your finger and shows the heart rate (which is also easy to measure in other ways) and the oxygen saturation in the blood (which is hard to measure any other way).

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))  **See note below!**
   &gt; ![](/images/blood-pressure.png)
   &gt; 
   &gt; There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However, it may be useful to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to <span style="color:red;">see/show</span><span style="color:green;">see / show</span> a trend in the patient's blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
   
   &gt; **However... What you should NOT do:** *You should not buy one of these, measure blood pressure, find something on the Internet that has a &quot;normal range,&quot; and panic if your blood pressure is higher or lower. Lots of people have high or low blood pressure, and stress has been known to raise blood pressure <span style="color:red;">(and/or</span><span style="color:green;">(and / or</span> heart rate). While regularly high blood pressure certainly might be something you want to mention to your doctor when you are there anyway, IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT YOU WANT TO BOTHER DOCTORS WITH IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.*
   
* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))
   &gt; ![](/images/sheet.png)
   &gt;
   &gt; Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us. <span style="color:green;">(In fact... Put two waterproof sheets on the bed, if it's still comfortable enough. Then removing the top layer in the middle of the night, if necessary, will hopefully be enough.)</span>

* **Steam inhaler** (25 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SNQH6CZ))
   &gt; ![](/images/steam.png)
   &gt;
   &gt; Often sold as &quot;face sauna&quot; or whatever other names, they're just devices that output steam that is not too hot to breathe. Any other method that produces steam is also OK, just make sure you don't do damage with steam that's too hot. The device takes demineralized or distilled water ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J5Y95MQ)), esp. in places where the tapwater is high in calcium. 
   &gt; **Warning:** Warm, wet devices are <span style="color:green;">also</span> excellent means of spreading the virus around. Probably use for one sick person at a time, or at least clean meticulously. <span style="color:green;">(It is not even advisable to share among people who are sick with the same thing at the same time, because it is possible that one person's viral load that happens to be higher could still adversely affect the other person.)</span>

* **Vitamins** <span style="color:red;">(a few EUR/USD)</span><span style="color:green;">(10 EUR/USD or so)</span> ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07S63PCZK))
   &gt; ![](/images/multi-vitamin.png)
   &gt;
   &gt; For when the patient doesn't eat (much) anymore but still drinks. Maybe take the big multi-vitamin pills that fizz into water, a couple of tubes of those. Try getting ones that contain roughly 1-2 times the daily recommended dose of all the vitamins and minerals they contain -- no crazy 1000% megadoses.
   
   <span style="color:green;">* **Hand Cream / Petroleum Jelly** (5+ EUR/USD)</span>
<span style="color:green;">   </span>
<span style="color:green;">   &gt; All that hand-washing really takes a toll on the skin!</span> 
   
   

#### Important Note

A note on the first two items: some medical professionals we talk to feel the non-medically trained will do more harm or good when they start taking SpO2 or blood pressure measurements. We include the devices here because they are in common use and we feel that in some places, during some periods, the health system is not going to be able to cope with the numbers of people falling ill, and we tip the balance towards the advantages in being able to see/show trends.

If you do decide you want to be able to measure blood pressure and SpO2, then at least properly familiarize yourself with the device. Practise! Also to get a good feel for what normal values in you and<span style="color:red;">or</span> your loved ones look like before anyone gets sick. Read our guidance on the main page on when **and when not** to seek help based on the information they provide.

&amp;nbsp;

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

<span style="color:red;">Shopping for</span><span style="color:green;">The topic of</span> PPE is<span style="color:red;">more than a little</span> tricky for several reasons.

First, this may all be new. You may not be familiar with what kinds of protection are needed in what situations. <span style="color:green;">It is important that you learn what types of PPE you need in what situations, how to fit it properly so that it works, how to safely don and doff it, and how to disinfect or dispose of it after use. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Second, advice has varied widely on this. In some countries, during some points of the pandemic, wearing masks in public is or has been mandatory. In other countries, it has been strongly encouraged as a social norm with few deviations. In others, wearing masks is mandatory if you are caring for a COVID-19 patient. And in still other countries, public health authorities have told people that wearing masks will not protect them. The protection offered by masks and other PPE is imperfect but important, especially for healthcare workers and other at-risk groups such as immunosuppressed people, and those with heart or lung disease. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Third, some people have been panic-buying and some companies have been price-gouging, making essential equipment like masks unavailable in some places even to doctors and nurses who really need them. If it's still early in the pandemic, your government may be providing masks to people who live with and / or care for people with COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get - or make - if you are ill, need to be caring for other people who are ill, or are in an at-risk group. **Listen to official advice on what *not* to buy** so as to not make things unavailable to the doctors and nurses who need them the most. </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### When to use PPE</span>

The World Health Organization offers <span style="color:red;">instructions</span><span style="color:green;">public advice</span> on [when to wear a mask and how to use masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks). You should wear a mask if you are ill with known or suspected COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of <span style="color:red;">breath), and</span><span style="color:green;">breath) but _absolutely_have_to_ go out; this protects other people. Wear one</span> whenever you are in the same room with someone who is ill with known or suspected <span style="color:red;">COVID-19. Keep your hands off</span><span style="color:green;">COVID-19; this is even mandatory in some countries' COVID-19 quarantine home care protocols. If you live somewhere with additional requirements such as wearing a mask in public,</span> your <span style="color:green;">government will let you know. Check under what circumstances authorities will provide you with masks. If you are in a special risk group for COVID-19 severity, then it probably also makes sense to wear a</span> mask <span style="color:green;">when you go out (if you have to go out)</span> while <span style="color:red;">you're wearing</span><span style="color:green;">the pandemic is ongoing. Similarly, if you are in a group that has more probable exposure, such as healthcare workers, teachers, or grocery store clerks, then</span> it <span style="color:green;">probably makes sense to treat yourself as a potential asymptomatic carrier,</span> and <span style="color:red;">keep using good hand-washing practices. Make sure</span><span style="color:green;">wear a mask in public to protect others. See the main text about further things to think about when it comes to containing the spread of the virus as much as possible.</span>

<span style="color:green;">Studies have shown that high-filtration respirators like the N95 work best to prevent respiratory disease transmission, followed by high-filtration surgical masks, and then low-filtration surgical masks. Research also shows that a home-made mask is better than no mask at all when it comes to filtering potentially dangerous particulate. So if</span> you <span style="color:red;">read some advice</span><span style="color:green;">cannot find a respirator or mask, try [making one yourself](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cloth-Face-Mask/). </span>

<span style="color:green;">If you do nothing but wear a mask when appropriate</span> and <span style="color:red;">watch some videos on</span><span style="color:green;">practice good hand hygiene, for most people, that's most of the PPE battle. But in addition to this, it makes sense to wear gloves</span> when <span style="color:green;">taking out the trash, as that involves touching fomites, objects like doorknobs</span> and <span style="color:green;">trash receptacle lids that are especially likely to transmit disease because many people touch them. Wearing gloves also makes sense when caring for someone who is ill. Gowns, caps, and eye protection probably only make sense for healthcare workers and people caring for someone with COVID-19 at home. Healthcare workers and others with particularly high exposures may even need to take additional PPE precautions where possible, like double-gowning, because worse initial exposures may be associated with worse disease outcomes (perhaps by causing higher starting viral loads). </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How to fit it properly</span>

<span style="color:green;">Much PPE is one-size-fits all (such as caps) or sized in large category chunks like small, medium, and large (such as gloves and gowns). Respirators are the hardest piece of PPE to fit. Take the time to look up some [videos on</span> how <span style="color:green;">to](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+fit+a+respirator+mask) properly mold one to your face with your fingers, covering your nose and cheekbones closely. Don't squeeze the bridge. Mask and respirator fit are especially important for keeping potentially dangerous particulate out (in the case of going out in public or taking care of patients) or in (in case you are ill, or an asymptomatic carrier). </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How</span> to safely <span style="color:green;">don and doff it</span>

<span style="color:green;">To</span> put <span style="color:red;">on, use,</span><span style="color:green;">it on: Create a clean zone (other than wearing your &quot;dirty&quot; / patient care / outside clothes) before donning PPE. Wash your hands first, then put on your mask, and keep your hands off your mask while you're wearing it. Then put on your gown and any other protective equipment -- while keeping it &quot;clean.&quot; This means, for example, ripping the gown's back-of-the-neck fastening so that you can put your arms into it without putting it over your head (to avoid smearing the gown against the mask). Always maintain good hand hygiene while wearing PPE. </span>

<span style="color:green;">To take it off: First remove your gloves and wash your hands. Then remove your gown and wash your hands again. Then remove any remaining PPE and wash your hands again. Then remove your &quot;dirty&quot; clothes and wash your hands again. Then put on your &quot;clean&quot; clothes</span> and <span style="color:green;">proceed to a zone you know is &quot;clean.&quot; </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How to disinfect or</span> dispose of <span style="color:red;">your</span><span style="color:green;">it after use</span>

<span style="color:green;">If you are disposing of</span> PPE <span style="color:green;">after use, you will want</span> to <span style="color:red;">make sure</span><span style="color:green;">place</span> it <span style="color:red;">really works</span><span style="color:green;">in a disposable trash bag. Some municipalities recommend double-bagging that bag / any possibly contaminated waste. Then place the trash aside for 72 hours before external disposal in a communal area or trash bin. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Under normal circumstances, most PPE is considered disposal, i.e., intended</span> to <span style="color:red;">protect you</span><span style="color:green;">be thrown away after one use. But a global pandemic with shortages in many countries of critical equipment including respirators / masks for healthcare workers</span> and <span style="color:red;">others. (This</span><span style="color:green;">others, does not present a normal set of circumstances. Now</span> is<span style="color:red;">especially true if you use</span> a <span style="color:red;">respirator</span><span style="color:green;">time to use what you have to the fullest. That means disinfecting</span> rather than <span style="color:red;">a mask: It</span><span style="color:green;">disposing of PPE whenever possible. </span>

<span style="color:green;">The best way to reuse PPE during this pandemic</span> is <span style="color:red;">surprisingly hard</span><span style="color:green;">probably</span> to <span style="color:red;">make sure your respirator has</span><span style="color:green;">mark seven masks or sets of PPE -- one for each day of the week. Rotate them after wearing to sit in a clean place for</span> a <span style="color:red;">proper fit.)</span><span style="color:green;">week. The virus should be dead after that period of time. There do not presently seem to be shortages of other PPE, but the same rotation decontamination strategy would apply. Alternately, if you need the mask(s) / respirator(s) decontaminated faster, bake them in the oven at 70 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. For hard surfaces like face shields and goggles, normal disinfectant solutions like Windex should kill the virus. For soft surfaces like cotton masks, spraying or soaking with alcohol or diluted hydrogen peroxide should do the trick. It seems likely, however, that using heat, chemicals, or other, faster potential decontamination techniques will result in worse overall wear and tear on the PPE than rotating a weekly set in and out of a clean place. Less wear and tear means better-protecting PPE.</span> 

<span style="color:red;">And then there's the fact that some people have been panic-buying and some companies have been price-gouging, making essential equipment like masks unavailable in some places even to doctors and nurses who really need them. If it's still early in the pandemic, your government may be providing masks to people who live with and/or care for people with COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get if you need to be caring for other people. </span>

<span style="color:red;">So first and foremost, and we mean this: **Listen to official advice on what *not* to buy** so as to not make things unavailable to the doctors and nurses who need them the most. Policies and general practice with regard to masks are going to vary wildly accross the world for a while to come. Going outside with a mask or wearing one in regular daily life if you are healthy is not supported by the scientific evidence on staying well. If you have access to a mask, it probably makes sense to wear one if you feel a little ill or are coughing but _absolutely_have_to_ go out. It also makes sense if you are taking care of someone who is sick. It is even mandatory in the COVID quarantine home care protocols in some countries. Check under what circumstances authorities will provide you with masks. See the main text about further things to think about when it comes to containing the spread of the virus as much as possible.</span>

* **Medical mask, preferably N95** (a few EUR/USD)
   &gt; ![](/images/mask.png)
   &gt; 
   &gt; FFP2 or FFP3 respirators are also recommended. A regular face mask (surgical or procedural) is better than nothing if you cannot get a respirator. Note that the respirators come in version with and without a valve. The valve (often a round plastic thingy) lets out the exhaled air unfiltered. This is fine if you're spraypainting, and it may be fine if you are protecting a known healthy person from a known sick person, but under no circumstances should the sick wear a version with a valve. 

<span style="color:red;">* **Gown / raincoat** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFDFFRX))</span>

<span style="color:red;">   &gt; Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown. </span>

* **Gloves** (less than a EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7))
   &gt; ![](/images/gloves.png)

<span style="color:green;">* **Gown / raincoat** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFDFFRX))</span>

<span style="color:green;">   &gt; Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown.</span> 

* **Eye protection, goggles or face shield** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002THV25Y))
