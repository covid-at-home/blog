## Level 2 -- Emerging Symptoms

![](/images/sneezing-emoji.png)

Notice if you suffer <span style="color:green;">anew</span> from any of the <span style="color:red;">following</span><span style="color:green;">following, most common</span> first <span style="color:green;">COVID-19</span> symptoms:

* Fever
* Fatigue
*<span style="color:red;">Sore throat</span>
<span style="color:red;">*</span> Dry <span style="color:red;">(unproductive)</span><span style="color:green;">(unproductive), persistent</span> cough<span style="color:red;">* Coughing up slime</span>
<span style="color:red;">* Joint / muscle pain</span> 
* Shortness of breath
* <span style="color:red;">Lack of hunger</span><span style="color:green;">Gastrointestinal symptoms</span>

<span style="color:green;">Fever seems to be the most common symptom -- but it's not universal. [Early data](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) reported low incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite). But [more recent evidence](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Documents/COVID_Digestive_Symptoms_AJG_Preproof.pdf) suggests they are common and can even precede respiratory symptoms.</span> Initial symptoms may also include <span style="color:green;">joint / muscle pain,</span> headache, chills, dizziness, nasal congestion,<span style="color:red;">abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea,</span> and <span style="color:red;">vomiting.</span><span style="color:green;">sore throat.</span> Later in the infection, symptoms may include <span style="color:red;">loss</span><span style="color:green;">[loss</span> of smell and <span style="color:red;">taste</span><span style="color:green;">taste](npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/26/821582951/is-loss-of-smell-and-taste-a-symptom-of-covid-19-doctors-want-to-find-out)</span> lasting for several days. 

<span style="color:green;">However, common colds, flu, and allergies can also cause many of the same symptoms. In fact, nasal congestion, itchy eyes, and sneezing most likely indicate a condition other than COVID-19, such as allergies. There is no single unique COVID-19 sign or symptom. There is no way to know for sure whether you have COVID-19 without testing for it.</span>

Is COVID-19 spread in the community where you live? Or have you been to an affected area or been around someone who was in an affected area? Then your symptoms could very well be COVID-19. But remember: In many areas, the odds that it's something else will still be greater.

&gt; Note: Fever is not subjective. You will need a thermometer (or <span style="color:red;">two),</span><span style="color:green;">two, in case one breaks),</span> and to keep track in a log of at least daily temperature. If you choose to take temperature internally (i.e., in the bottom / rectum), it will be more precise. Be sure you have enough wipes and alcohol to clean the thermometer after each use. If taking temperature orally, don’t eat or drink for 20 minutes beforehand. Either way, note the method in your <span style="color:red;">log</span><span style="color:green;">illness diary (more on this below),</span> so <span style="color:green;">that</span> healthcare personnel know which it is. (Around <span style="color:red;">.7 degrees</span><span style="color:green;">.7°</span> Celsius <span style="color:green;">or 1° Farenheit</span> is often added to oral temperatures.) Here are some good instructions for [how to take an oral temperature](https://www.drugs.com/cg/how-to-take-an-oral-temperature.html).

### <span style="color:red;">Diagnosis</span><span style="color:green;">If you don't have symptoms</span>

<span style="color:red;">There will</span><span style="color:green;">Some people may</span> be <span style="color:red;">different policies surrounding</span><span style="color:green;">exposed to, carry, and infect others with the virus -- without ever showing symptoms themselves. These people are asymptomatic carriers. They seem to be common; they may number around [one in four](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/china-pivots-to-tackle-silent-covid-19-carriers-as-us-says-a-quarter-of-cases-may-have-no-symptoms) of those infected. Unless widespread</span> testing <span style="color:red;">for COVID-19 based on</span><span style="color:green;">is available</span> where you are <span style="color:red;">and what stage of the pandemic your area</span><span style="color:green;">(which</span> is <span style="color:red;">in. Check online, call official hotline numbers, follow official guidelines, and consider driving to</span><span style="color:green;">currently</span> a <span style="color:red;">drive-through testing center</span><span style="color:green;">small minority of places), it may not be possible to determine</span> if <span style="color:red;">your area has</span><span style="color:green;">you are</span> one <span style="color:red;">and</span><span style="color:green;">of them. This is one of</span> the <span style="color:red;">patient qualifies for testing. **You</span><span style="color:green;">reasons why everyone</span> should <span style="color:red;">not just show up at a doctor's office or a hospital unannounced if you just experience</span><span style="color:green;">currently be following</span> the <span style="color:red;">first symptoms.**</span><span style="color:green;">advice of public health authorities that generally includes social distancing measures covered in Level 1.</span> 

<span style="color:red;">&gt; Remember: Hospitals are bad places to be until</span><span style="color:green;">### If</span> you<span style="color:red;">absolutely</span> have <span style="color:red;">to be there: You and / or the patient run the risk of getting additional infections that, when bacterial or fungal, are much more likely to be resistant to standard treatments due to the nature of the hospital environment. Also: Many hospitals are going to be overloaded.</span><span style="color:green;">symptoms</span>

<span style="color:red;">### Don't Panic -</span>The <span style="color:red;">Worried Well</span><span style="color:green;">single most important thing once you have symtoms that might be COVID-19 is to stay at home, or to go home if you discover them while not at home. Call in sick. Stay away from people as much as possible and go to a separate room if you live with others. If you live alone, let someone (friend, family) know that you are ill and will keep letting them know how you're doing.</span> 

<span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.begin }}</span>

<span style="color:green;">#### Symptoms? Maybe you need to register...</span>

<span style="color:green;">As this point you need up-to-date local information. Your health authorities may want to know if you have symptoms. Reasons for this may include population monitoring to see where the virus is, planning the government's response as well as opening a channel to follow up with you personally. There may be a phone number to call if you have symptoms, or a website to visit, or an app to download. Just figure out what the authorities in your area want you to do as soon as you have isolated yourself from others.</span>

<span style="color:green;">#### Diagnosis</span>

<span style="color:green;">You will want to know whether what you have is just a cold, a flu or actual COVID-19. There will be different policies surrounding testing for COVID-19 based on where you are and what stage of the pandemic your area is in. Check online, call official hotline numbers, follow official guidelines. If testing capacity is limited, you may not qualify for testing, even if you have all the symptoms of COVID-19. </span>

<span style="color:green;">You may find that the official information on getting tested doesn't always match the reality on the ground. It may be impossible to get through, the queues may be way too long or the waiting conditions unsafe. (You don't want to get COVID-19 from trying to find out if you have it.)</span>

<span style="color:green;">In some cities, your regular doctor will come to your home in full gear to swab your throat. In other places there are drive-throughs. There are also Do-It-Yourself test kits you can order by mail where you perform your own throat swab and send it to the lab for testing. The availability of all of these methods will differ depending on where you are, who you are, what stage the pandemic is in and many other factors. We cannot possibly give you any general advice other than to inform yourself as soon as you have isolated yourself.</span>

<span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.end }}</span>

<span style="color:green;">**Under no circumstances should you just show up at a doctor's office or a hospital unannounced if you experience symptoms.**</span>

<span style="color:green;">&gt; Remember: This is for your own protection as well as that of the other patients. Hospitals are bad places to be until you absolutely have to be there: You run the risk of getting additional infections that, when bacterial or fungal, are much more likely to be resistant to standard treatments due to the nature of the hospital environment. Also: Many hospitals are going to be overloaded, so waiting times may be astronomical.</span>

<span style="color:green;">### Don't Panic</span> 

For most people, this will be as bad as it gets. You'll be a little sick, and then you'll get better. Done. 

At the same time, some people will not be so lucky. Even if only a relatively small percentage of those affected need medical care, this will put a serious strain on doctors, <span style="color:red;">nurses</span><span style="color:green;">nurses,</span> and available medical resources. We can all <span style="color:red;">help.</span><span style="color:green;">help them by staying home whenever possible.</span> 

The &quot;Worried Well&quot; <span style="color:red;">are</span><span style="color:green;">is a medical term for</span> people who visit the doctor when they are not really (all that) sick, because they need reassurance. The coming weeks and months are not a good time for that. This website aims to give you more confidence and preparedness in caring for yourself, friends, and loved ones until you / they actually need professional help.

<span style="color:green;">Consider using relaxation techniques to slow a rapid respiration or heart rate that may be partially due to anxiety (or just to chill out): </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Listen to soothing music.</span>
<span style="color:green;">- Check in with a friend electronically.</span>
<span style="color:green;">- See if you can slow your breathing and bring down your heart rate by counting longer for forceful exhaling than for gentle inhaling. Some people use 4-7-8, and others prefer 5-2-5 to try slowing down their inhale-hold-exhale patterns. Use what feels best for you.</span> 

### Self-quarantine

Until tested and depending on where you are and where you have been, <span style="color:red;">it may be prudent to</span><span style="color:green;">simply</span> assume the patient (you? a family member?) has COVID-19. That means self-quarantine at home. No more visitors, a sign on the door, and the patient should not go out unless there is no chance of meeting anyone. Different areas have different standards for what it means to self-quarantine when there are other people in the household. If possible, you will want to err on the side of safety and try to get everything delivered for 2 weeks. Things may change, as in some areas the virus will become so common (endemic) that many people will have had it. There is no telling at what point various authorities will stop testing every potential infection, and it will differ from region to region.

<span style="color:green;">### Garbage</span>

<span style="color:green;">During this time at least, err on the side of caution when it comes to waste disposal. Used tissues, paper towels, and other possibly contaminated disposable items should be bagged in disposable trash bags, tied securely, and put aside for 72 hours prior to external disposal. Some municipalities also recommend placing these items in a second disposable trash bag. If you use communal garbage bins, disinfect the handles when possible before and after use. Wash your hands after handling trash and bins. </span>

<span style="color:green;">### PPE</span>

<span style="color:green;">Now at the latest is time to think about Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). If you can get masks AND IF MASKS ARE NOT IN SHORT SUPPLY FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES WHERE YOU ARE, wear one outdoors. You are not supposed to be outdoors when you have symptoms, we know. But we mean even just when putting out the trash. If you have no mask, at least do something. Wrap a towel around your nose and mouth, breathe through a scarf, anything is better than nothing. Here are a few [recommendations for PPE](https://covid-at-home.info/shopping) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, summarized and expanded on briefly below: </span>

<span style="color:green;">- Use PPE if you are sick and have to be around other people, or if you feel well but have to be around someone who is sick (e.g., caring for someone). </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Use a high-filtration respirator like an N95, FFP2, or FFP3 if you can. Next-preferred would be a regular medical face mask (surgical or procedural). Then a home-made or improvised mask. Just use something. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Use disposable gloves to take out the trash when you are ill, or when caring for someone who is ill. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- It may make sense to also use a cap, gown, and eye protection if you are caring for someone with COVID-19 at home. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Fitting respirators properly is hard and important; look up [some videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+fit+a+respirator+mask) and mold it to your face with your fingers without squeezing the bridge. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Take care putting it on. Start in a clean zone with clean hands and keep your PPE as clean as possible. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Take care taking it off. First remove gloves and wash hands, then remove mask and wash hands, then remove any other PPE or dirty clothes and wash hands. Then put on clean clothes and get back to a clean zone. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Dispose of used gloves in a disposable trash bag, double-bagging and / or placing the trash aside for 72 hours before external disposal. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Although this is not normal, you probably want to reuse masks since they are already in short supply globally (and the same may become true for other PPE). The best way to reuse PPE is to mark seven sets -- one for each day of the week. Rotate them after wearing to sit in a clean place for a week. If you need respirators / masks decontaminated faster, bake them in the oven at 70° Celsius (around 160° Farenheit) for 30 minutes.</span> 

### Family, flatmates, etc.

<span style="color:red;">Household members of people who are known or suspected to be infected should treat themselves as potentially also infected and self-quarantine too, while keeping the maximum practicable distance from the patient for as long as the patient can take care of him- or herself. This means being in different rooms, sleeping in different beds, eating separately, using different dishes and towels, and when possible, using different bathrooms.</span><span style="color:green;">{{site.breakout.begin}}</span>

<span style="color:red;">Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces</span><span style="color:green;">Seek up-to-date local information if you live</span> with <span style="color:red;">household bleach diluted</span><span style="color:green;">others. The authorities may provide you</span> with <span style="color:red;">water: 10 ml / 2 tsp bleach with half a liter / 2 cups of water (carefully washing measurement tools before reuse). You can put that solution in a disused plant sprayer</span><span style="color:green;">different or more detailed instructions, advice,</span> or <span style="color:red;">cleaner spray bottle. You should give the spray a minute to work on surfaces before wiping it dry.</span><span style="color:green;">even PPE materials.</span>

<span style="color:red;">Now at the latest is time to think about Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). If you can get masks AND IF MASKS ARE NOT IN SHORT SUPPLY FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES WHERE YOU ARE, wear one. Depending on your situation, disposable gloves, long-sleeve protective gowns, and eye protection may also be appropriate. The [shopping page](/shopping) on this website contains some ideas for personal protection items, as well as important information on when and how to use them. Depending on the stage of the disease where you are, the authorities may provide you with more detailed advice, instructions or even PPE materials if you are caring for a patient.</span><span style="color:green;">{{site.breakout.end}}</span>

<span style="color:green;">Here are some general suggestions and tips for dealing with family and flatmates if you have or suspect you may have COVID-19: </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **Self-quarantine from the outside...** Household members of people who are known or suspected to be infected should treat themselves as potentially also infected and self-quarantine, too. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **... and distance on the inside.&quot;** They should also keep the maximum practicable distance from the patient for as long as the patient can take care of him- or herself. This means being in different rooms, sleeping in different beds, eating separately, using different dishes and towels, and when possible, using different bathrooms. We know, it's weird and sometimes heartbreakingly hard. But this is a potentially lethal disease and the people close to you will (hopefully) understand. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **Clean the kitchen faucet.** Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces (doorknobs, lightswitches, table surfaces, keyboards, phones, toilet handles if in shared bathrooms, kitchen faucet handles if in shared kitchens -- you get the idea) with a regular household cleaner (e.g., Lysol, Windex), hydrogen peroxide solution, or diluted bleach (10 ml / 2 tsp bleach with half a liter / 2 cups of water; carefully washing measurement tools before reuse). You can put that solution in a disused plant sprayer or cleaner spray bottle. Give the cleaner a minute to work on surfaces before wiping it dry. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- **Consider PPE.** Your housemates might want to wear masks indoors, too. When they handle your trash or laundry, disposable gloves are also a good idea.</span> 

In most places, there will probably come a time when the number of cases skyrockets, many people have already had COVID-19, and authorities will no longer keep records of who has had it and who hasn't. The <span style="color:red;">basis</span><span style="color:green;">basics</span> then remain the same: Try to protect <span style="color:green;">other people, especially those middle-aged or</span> older<span style="color:red;">people</span> and people with existing <span style="color:red;">illnesses</span><span style="color:green;">illnesses,</span> as much as <span style="color:red;">possible, and</span><span style="color:green;">possible. And</span> try to minimize <span style="color:green;">the</span> spread whenever you can, as best you can. Remember: The more we can slow<span style="color:red;">down</span> or <span style="color:red;">altogether lessen</span><span style="color:green;">stop</span> the disease's spread, the better it is for everyone. Because by helping to slow or stop the spread, you<span style="color:red;">can</span> help lessen how overwhelmed the healthcare system is going to become. That in turn increases the proportion and number of people who need medical <span style="color:red;">care,</span><span style="color:green;">care (for any reason),</span> who are able to access it. This helps doctors and nurses save more lives. 

### Diary

When symptoms first start is the right time to start an illness diary. 

A few times a day, preferably at somewhat regular hours or points in your normal routines or rhythms (e.g., every morning before making coffee or tea), measure temperature, even if you don't feel like you have a fever (yet). Weigh once a day if possible. Also note respiratory and heart rates in breaths and beats per minute. It will get you used to doing these things, give you practise, and (if you start early) give you some idea what (more or less) healthy values for you look like. Not necessary, but extra points for blood pressure and oxygenation (Devices to measure those are cheap, see the [shopping page](/shopping)). 

Then write down any symptoms the patient has. If he or she is in pain, where and when is the pain, and how bad on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)? How bad is the cough? What color if there is mucus being produced? Be sure to note what medication, if any, the patient takes. 

Paracetamol (also known as <span style="color:green;">Tylenol or</span> acetaminophen) is a good choice for fever and pain suppression. Keeping an illness diary will also help you to keep track of how much you've taken, when, to ensure you treat fever adequately without taking more than the recommended amount in a 24-hour period.

[![](/images/diary-small-slanted.png)](/diary)

#### Printable illness diary

We made a **[printable illness diary](/diary)** that you can use to write down all the information you collect when you take temperature, breathing rate, etc. Please check out the form and our webpage about it via the link above.

<span style="color:green;">### Contact lenses</span>

<span style="color:green;">Even when you are not that ill yet, it is much better to use glasses if you have them, and stop routinely putting in contact lenses in the morning. You do not want to touch your eyes more than you have to because they may get [infected](https://icrcat.com/en/coronavirus-and-conjunctivitis/), and if and when you do get more ill, you do not want to risk forgetting that you have them in.</span>

### Get healthy again

<span style="color:green;">- **Treat fever with care**. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  -</span> Treat pain and fever with over-the-counter medication at the recommended safe dosages. Use paracetamol<span style="color:red;">(also known as acetaminophen)</span> if you can. 
  <span style="color:green;">- Fever is part of the body's natural defenses. Research suggests [medicating fever less](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16433601) rather than more aggressively is safer. This means medicating a temperature of over 40° Celsius (104° Farenheit) -- and not medicating a lower fever. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  -</span> Questions are <span style="color:green;">also</span> emerging surrounding the safety of ibuprofen / non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as corticosteroids / steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, in case of coronavirus. If possible, avoid their use if you have symptoms. 
   <span style="color:green;">-</span> An additional safe way to treat fever is to take a bath or shower. The water temperature should be comfortable, not cold, because shivering can raise your core body temperature <span style="color:red;">-</span><span style="color:green;">--</span> and the idea is to lower it. When you get out of the bath or shower, the leftover water evaporating<span style="color:red;">like sweat</span> from your skin can help lower your temperature. 

<span style="color:green;">- **Keep eating**.</span> Try to keep eating nutritious food. Nothing too heavy, not too much at the same time. Lots of vitamins and fresh produce. Adequate carbohydrates (potatoes, rice, pasta, <span style="color:red;">etc). Inhale steam 3+ times a day. Go for a daily walk when possible, while keeping distance from other people. If your throat is irritated, avoid acidic drinks (such as soda and juice) as they can be further irritating; water and teas</span><span style="color:green;">etc.)</span> are <span style="color:red;">better choices then.</span><span style="color:green;">also essential for immune function.</span> 

<span style="color:red;">Notice the color and amount of your urine. If it is dark (more colored than clear), or there is not</span><span style="color:green;">- **Steam**. Inhale steam 3+ times</span> a <span style="color:red;">lot, drink more water. It is very important to avoid and treat dehydration by drinking enough, even though it can be hard</span><span style="color:green;">day. The best way</span> to <span style="color:red;">drink enough when you have</span><span style="color:green;">do this is with</span> a <span style="color:red;">fever / are sweating</span><span style="color:green;">[steam inhaler](https://covid-at-home.info/shopping),</span> a <span style="color:red;">lot, and are suffering from fatigue and discomfort due</span><span style="color:green;">device that outputs steam that is not too hot</span> to <span style="color:red;">illness. If you are struggling</span><span style="color:green;">breathe. A humidifier or shower also works. The older method many people know is</span> to <span style="color:red;">drink enough</span><span style="color:green;">boil water in a pot</span> and <span style="color:red;">beginning to show signs of dehydration like darker urine,</span><span style="color:green;">then put your head over it, under a dishtowel; just make sure</span> you <span style="color:red;">might also try eating foods containing more</span><span style="color:green;">don't do damage with hot</span> water<span style="color:red;">(e.g., cucumber, oranges, apples), sipping on boullion</span> or <span style="color:red;">soup, or setting a small goal for yourself (e.g., every time you get up, drink</span><span style="color:green;">steam that's too hot to breathe. There are no miracle cures and this is no exception; it just helps your airways open and drain</span> a <span style="color:red;">glass of water).</span><span style="color:green;">bit better.</span> 

<span style="color:green;">- **Keep moving**. Go for a daily walk in the fresh air and sunlight when possible, while keeping your safe distance from other people. </span>

<span style="color:green;">- **Keep drinking**. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - This is really key. Drinking enough fluids helps the lungs produce secretions, and helps those secretions it does produce be thin enough to potentially cough up. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - If your throat is irritated, avoid acidic drinks (such as soda and juice) as they can be further irritating; water and teas are better choices then. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - How much is enough? Notice the color and amount of your urine. If it is dark (more colored than clear), or there is not a lot, drink more water.</span>
<span style="color:green;">   - It is very important to avoid and treat dehydration by drinking enough, even though it can be hard to drink enough when you have a fever / are sweating a lot, and are suffering from fatigue and discomfort due to illness. If you are struggling to drink enough and beginning to show signs of dehydration like darker urine, you might also try eating foods containing more water (e.g., cucumber, oranges, apples), sipping on boullion or soup, or setting a small goal for yourself (e.g., every time you get up, drink a glass of water). </span>

<span style="color:green;">- **Encourage coughing**. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  -</span> Coughing can be an important, healthy effort on the part of the body to clear the lungs of fluid so you can breathe easier. <span style="color:green;">It's also exercise for your lungs. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  -</span> Do not suppress a productive cough all the time / just because you don't want to be coughing. However, if you want to try to suppress your cough enough to get a good night's sleep so your body can better heal itself, then over-the-counter cough medications, herbal teas such as anise / chamomile, cocoa, and lozenges can help. 
  <span style="color:green;">-</span> Some over-the-counter cough medications contain ingredients like guaifenesin or NAC, generally considered safe mucolytics that relieve coughing by helping your body get rid of mucus (usually by making it thinner and so easier to cough up); your pharmacist can help you find one that's right for you. 

<span style="color:green;">- **Get up, stand up**. Other simple ways to try to prevent pneumonia and other lung complications from developing typically include: </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Sitting upright as much as possible to help fluids drain. Do not lie flat in bed all day. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Getting up and moving periodically. Although you may be very tired (malaise) due to your illness, being upright and moving around can similarly help fluids drain. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Expanding your lungs by breathing deeply (in and out), and raising your arms (up above your head and down again). </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Opening the window and breathing the fresh air, especially if breathlessness (dyspnea) is bothering you. </span>
<span style="color:green;">  - Exercising your fuller lung capacity by blowing up a balloon every hour (or using any other toy you might have on hand that exercises lung capacity). This is a particularly good idea if your breathing is fast and / or you are feeling breathless. Be gentle and patient with yourself. Focus on taking deep breaths all the way in and all the way out, and remember lung capacity is like muscle strength: You can build it up by repeated exercise.</span> 

### Feeling better?

<span style="color:red;">Before you break your quarantine, health authorities may want to (re)test you to see you are really not contagious anymore. But maybe the number of cases is already so high that people will have to make their own decisions. Err on the side of safety and try to stay home for a little longer than officially indicated. The [World Health Organization recommendation](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---16-march-2020) is to continue isolation for at least two weeks after symptoms disappear, even if you are no longer feeling sick.</span><span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout_begin }}</span>

If <span style="color:green;">your symptoms go away, that doesn't mean you should end your quarantine immediately. You need up-to-date local information again to see whether the authorities want you to register as healed, espcially if you tested positive earlier. Depending on availability and local policy, you may need to be tested again. Your local health authorities may provide you with specific advice on what to do next. If so: follow it.</span>

<span style="color:green;">Absent of up-to-date local instructions from authorities, you should err on the side of safety and try to stay in isolation for a little longer than officially indicated. The [World Health Organization recommendation](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---16-march-2020) is to **continue isolation for at least two weeks after symptoms disappear, even if you are no longer feeling sick**. </span>

You now know that your body <span style="color:red;">(presumably,</span><span style="color:green;">*(presumably,</span> keep watching the latest science on <span style="color:red;">this)</span><span style="color:green;">this)*</span> has built immunity. Which means that this thing is over for you, <span style="color:green;">and, if you are young</span> and <span style="color:green;">healthy,</span> also that you are a more logical choice to help your family and friends when they get sick.
