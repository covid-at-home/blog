## Shopping list

<span style="color:red;">In addition</span><span style="color:green;">The standard advice is</span> to <span style="color:red;">having approximately</span><span style="color:green;">have about</span> 2-4 weeks of essentials like groceries and other <span style="color:green;">basic</span> household <span style="color:red;">supplies,</span><span style="color:green;">supplies in case of emergencies such as this (a pandemic). Basically you want to have a surplus of what you normally have on hand, but with some emphasis on longer shelf-life foods, for sheltering in place. You will also want to think about some things you might not normally have on hand, namely, simple medical supplies (e.g., fever thermometer) and personal protective equipment (&quot;PPE&quot;; e,g, mask and gloves). </span>

<span style="color:green;">### Food</span>

<span style="color:green;">Your diet will likely change due to changed food availability (e.g., fewer grocery store runs or deliveries in favor of staying home or limiting contact; no more restaurants). But in most countries at this time (and probably for some time to come), you can likely still enjoy much the same sort of diverse and nutritious diet you had access to previously. Here are a few [suggestions and tips](/food) for keeping 2-4 weeks' worth of healthy food that you like on-hand. See the main page for more general advice on staying healthy food-wise.</span>
<span style="color:green;">   </span>
<span style="color:green;">### Household supplies</span>

<span style="color:green;">Everyone and their brother has already thought to stock up on toilet paper, infamously leading to shortages and even social unrest (from organized crime to public brawling) in various places worldwide. Maybe when it comes to things you know may be in short supply due to panic buying (like toilet paper), only buy a little bit every week. Share with your neighbors if you have it and they don't. Things will be crazy throughout this crisis from time to time, but people all over the world are using the opportunity to ask the people around them what they need -- and that kind of kindness builds the strength and resilience that we all need to get through this thing together. </span>

<span style="color:green;">That said, it probably makes sense to have a back-up of your regular household essentials. That means different things to different people, but common items to keep a back-up of in case of emergency include:</span>
<span style="color:green;">- Laundry detergent. You can buy liquid laundry detergent to wash things in the sink or tub/shower if you don't have a washing machine. In a pinch (or for delicates like underwear), dish or hand soap works as well. Just use something; it's not a good time to go to the laundromat. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Dish soap. Not just for dishes and (in a pinch) laundry; also works as a back-up all-purpose cleaner, diluted in warm water, for most floors and surfaces. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Shampoo, conditioner, bar soap for the body.</span>
<span style="color:green;">- Hand soap and moisturizer / petroleum jelly. All that hand-washing really takes a toll on the skin! </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, anything else you need for good oral hygiene. (It's not a good time to need a dentist.) </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Paper towels, antiseptic wipes, bathroom wet wipes, tissues. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Cleaning supplies. Disposable paper towels and spray glass cleaner or really any other type of cleaner that cuts oil (dish soapy water, shower cleaner, diluted bleach or hydrogen peroxide) -- any of these works by dissolving the virus's lipid (fat) membrane. This inactivates it. Contain contaminated cleaning materials safely inside your garbage bag. Here's a fuller [list](https://www.consumerreports.org/cleaning/common-household-products-that-can-destroy-novel-coronavirus/). </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Pads, tampons, condoms, whatever else you need to stay clean and safe. </span>
<span style="color:green;">- Disposable garbage bags. Not a good thing to run out of when you're sick and will need to dispose of your tissues safely eventually! </span>

<span style="color:green;">### Other supplies</span>

<span style="color:green;">In addition to having around 2-4 weeks of essentials,</span> here are some <span style="color:red;">necessary and handy</span><span style="color:green;">other</span> things <span style="color:green;">you might want or need</span> to have if you are going to be taking care of someone with COVID-19. None of this is very expensive or requires special training to use. 

If we included examples (generally on the German version of Amazon), this is not a buying recommendation and we are not making any money if you click that precise one (or any other). By showing you the example, we mean nothing more than *&quot;something like this.&quot;* Use whatever online or retail channel you like to get something similar. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Must have

* **Fever thermometer** (2-10 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001NYHXYS))

   <span style="color:red;">&gt;![](/images/thermometer.png)</span><span style="color:green;">&gt; ![](/assets/images/thermometer.png)</span>
   &gt; 
   &gt; So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks, they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted <span style="color:red;">anally</span><span style="color:green;">in the bottom</span> to get a more precise measurement, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   &gt; Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: Once people get sick, you want to change the bed linens often, and you may use more towels also.
   
<span style="color:red;">* **Cleaning supplies, bleach**</span>

* **Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, Tylenol or Panadol)**

  &gt; The fever supressant and painkiller of choice. Make sure you follow the packaging instructions and <span style="color:red;">do not exceed</span><span style="color:green;">stay at or under</span> the<span style="color:red;">maximum</span> recommended daily dose. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Nice to have

* **Pulse oxymeter** (20-25 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P3ZS6L3))  **See note below!**
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/pulse-oxi.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/pulse-oxi.png)</span>
   &gt;
   &gt; Little gadget that clips on your finger and shows the heart rate (which is also easy to measure in other ways) and the oxygen saturation in the blood (which is hard to measure any other way).

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))  **See note below!**
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/blood-pressure.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/blood-pressure.png)</span>
   &gt; 
   &gt; There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However, it may be useful to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to <span style="color:red;">see/show</span><span style="color:green;">see / show</span> a trend in the patient's blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
   
   &gt; **However... What you should NOT do:** *You should not buy one of these, measure blood pressure, find something on the Internet that has a &quot;normal range,&quot; and panic if your blood pressure is higher or lower. Lots of people have high or low blood pressure, and stress has been known to raise blood pressure <span style="color:red;">(and/or</span><span style="color:green;">(and / or</span> heart rate). While regularly high blood pressure certainly might be something you want to mention to your doctor when you are there anyway, IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT YOU WANT TO BOTHER DOCTORS WITH IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.*
   
* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/sheet.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/sheet.png)</span>
   &gt;
   &gt; Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us. <span style="color:green;">(In fact... Put two waterproof sheets on the bed, if it's still comfortable enough. Then removing the top layer in the middle of the night, if necessary, will hopefully be enough.)</span>

* **Steam inhaler** (25 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SNQH6CZ))
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/steam.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/steam.png)</span>
   &gt;
   &gt; Often sold as &quot;face sauna&quot; or whatever other names, they're just devices that output steam that is not too hot to breathe. Any other method that produces steam is also OK, just make sure you don't do damage with steam that's too hot. The device takes demineralized or distilled water ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J5Y95MQ)), esp. in places where the tapwater is high in calcium. 
   &gt; **Warning:** Warm, wet devices are <span style="color:green;">also</span> excellent means of spreading the virus around. Probably use for one sick person at a time, or at least clean meticulously. <span style="color:green;">(It is not even advisable to share among people who are sick with the same thing at the same time, because exposure to one person's viral load that happens to be higher might still harm the other person.)</span>

* **Vitamins** <span style="color:red;">(a few EUR/USD)</span><span style="color:green;">(10 EUR/USD or so)</span> ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07S63PCZK))
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/multi-vitamin.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/multi-vitamin.png)</span>
   &gt;
   &gt; For when the patient doesn't eat (much) anymore but still drinks. Maybe take the big multi-vitamin pills that fizz into water, a couple of tubes of those. Try getting ones that contain roughly 1-2 times the daily recommended dose of all the vitamins and minerals they contain -- no crazy 1000% megadoses.
   

#### Important Note

A note on the first two items: <span style="color:red;">some</span><span style="color:green;">Some</span> medical professionals we talk to feel the non-medically trained will do more harm <span style="color:red;">or</span><span style="color:green;">than</span> good when they start taking SpO2 or blood pressure measurements. We include the devices here because they are in common use and we feel that in some places, during some periods, the health system is not going to be able to cope with the numbers of people falling <span style="color:red;">ill, and we tip the balance towards the</span><span style="color:green;">ill. The</span> advantages <span style="color:red;">in</span><span style="color:green;">of</span> being able to <span style="color:red;">see/show trends.</span><span style="color:green;">see / show trends tip the balance.</span> 

If you do decide you want to be able to measure blood pressure and SpO2, then at least properly familiarize yourself with the device. Practise! Also to get a good feel for what normal values in you and<span style="color:red;">or</span> your loved ones look like before anyone gets sick. Read our guidance on the main page on when **and when not** to seek help based on the information they provide.

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

<span style="color:red;">Shopping for</span><span style="color:green;">The topic of</span> PPE is<span style="color:red;">more than a little</span> tricky for several reasons.

First, this may all be new. You may not be familiar with what kinds of protection are needed in what situations. <span style="color:red;">The World Health Organization offers instructions on [when to wear a mask and how to use masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks). You should wear a mask if</span><span style="color:green;">It is important that</span> you <span style="color:red;">are ill with known or suspected COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness</span><span style="color:green;">learn what types</span> of <span style="color:red;">breath), and whenever</span><span style="color:green;">PPE</span> you <span style="color:red;">are</span><span style="color:green;">need</span> in <span style="color:red;">the same room with someone who is ill with known or suspected COVID-19. Keep your hands off your mask while you're wearing</span><span style="color:green;">what situations, how to fit</span> it <span style="color:red;">and keep using good hand-washing practices. Make sure you read some advice and watch some videos on when and</span><span style="color:green;">properly so that it works,</span> how to safely <span style="color:red;">put on, use,</span><span style="color:green;">don and doff it,</span> and <span style="color:green;">how to disinfect or</span> dispose of<span style="color:red;">your PPE to make sure</span> it <span style="color:red;">really works to protect you and others. (This is especially true if you use a respirator rather than a mask: It is surprisingly hard to make sure your respirator has a proper fit.)</span><span style="color:green;">after use.</span> 

<span style="color:red;">And then there's the fact that some people have been panic-buying and</span><span style="color:green;">Second, advice has varied widely on this. In</span> some <span style="color:red;">companies have been price-gouging, making essential equipment like masks unavailable in</span><span style="color:green;">countries, during</span> some <span style="color:red;">places even to doctors and nurses who really need them. If it's still early in</span><span style="color:green;">points of</span> the pandemic, <span style="color:red;">your government may be providing</span><span style="color:green;">wearing</span> masks <span style="color:red;">to people who live with and/or care for people</span><span style="color:green;">in public is or has been mandatory. In other countries, it has been strongly encouraged as a social norm</span> with <span style="color:red;">COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get</span><span style="color:green;">few deviations. In others, wearing masks is mandatory</span> if you <span style="color:red;">need to be</span><span style="color:green;">are</span> caring for <span style="color:green;">a COVID-19 patient. And in still other countries, public health authorities have told people that wearing masks will not protect them. The protection offered by masks and other PPE is imperfect but important, especially for healthcare workers and</span> other <span style="color:red;">people.</span><span style="color:green;">at-risk groups such as immunosuppressed people, and those with heart or lung disease.</span> 

<span style="color:red;">So first</span><span style="color:green;">Third, some people have been panic-buying</span> and <span style="color:red;">foremost,</span><span style="color:green;">some companies have been price-gouging, making essential equipment like masks unavailable in some places even to doctors</span> and <span style="color:red;">we mean this:</span><span style="color:green;">nurses who really need them. If it's still early in the pandemic, your government may be providing masks to people who live with and / or care for people with COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get - or make - if you are ill, need to be caring for other people who are ill, or are in an at-risk group.</span> **Listen to official advice on what *not* to buy** so as to not make things unavailable to the doctors and nurses who need them the most. 

<span style="color:red;">Policies and general practice with regard</span><span style="color:green;">#### When</span> to <span style="color:red;">masks are going to vary wildly accross the world for a while</span><span style="color:green;">use PPE</span>

<span style="color:green;">The World Health Organization offers public advice on [when</span> to <span style="color:red;">come. Going outside with</span><span style="color:green;">wear</span> a mask <span style="color:red;">or wearing one in regular daily life if you are healthy is not supported by the scientific evidence on staying well. If you have access</span><span style="color:green;">and how</span> to <span style="color:red;">a mask, it probably makes sense</span><span style="color:green;">use masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks). </span>

<span style="color:green;">When</span> to wear <span style="color:red;">one</span><span style="color:green;">a mask:</span>
<span style="color:green;">* You should wear a mask</span> if you <span style="color:red;">feel a little</span><span style="color:green;">are</span> ill <span style="color:green;">with known</span> or <span style="color:red;">are coughing</span><span style="color:green;">suspected COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath)</span> but <span style="color:red;">_absolutely_have_to_</span><span style="color:green;">**absolutely have to**</span> go <span style="color:red;">out. It also makes sense if</span><span style="color:green;">out; this protects other people. </span>
<span style="color:green;">* Wear one whenever</span> you are <span style="color:red;">taking care of</span><span style="color:green;">in the same room with</span> someone who is <span style="color:red;">sick. It</span><span style="color:green;">ill with known or suspected COVID-19. This</span> is even mandatory in <span style="color:red;">the COVID</span><span style="color:green;">some countries' COVID-19</span> quarantine home care <span style="color:red;">protocols</span><span style="color:green;">protocols. </span>
<span style="color:green;">* If you live somewhere with additional requirements such as everyone wearing a mask</span> in <span style="color:red;">some countries.</span><span style="color:green;">public, your government will let you know.</span> Check under what circumstances authorities will provide you with masks. 
<span style="color:green;">* If you are in a special risk group for COVID-19 severity, then it probably also makes sense to wear a mask when you go out (if you have to go out) while the pandemic is ongoing. </span>
<span style="color:green;">* Similarly, if you are in a group that has more probable exposure, such as healthcare workers, teachers, or grocery store clerks, then it probably makes sense to treat yourself as a potential asymptomatic carrier, and wear a mask in public to protect others. Covering your nose and mouth when you go out in public protects not just you from getting infected, but also protects others from the possibility that you might be asymptomatic and infect them.</span> See the main text about further things to think about when it comes to containing the spread of the virus as much as possible.

<span style="color:green;">Studies have shown that high-filtration respirators like the N95 work best to prevent respiratory disease transmission, followed by high-filtration surgical masks, and then low-filtration surgical masks. Research also shows that a home-made mask is better than no mask at all when it comes to filtering potentially dangerous particulate. So if you cannot find a respirator or mask, try [making one yourself](https://covid-at-home.info/facemask). </span>

<span style="color:green;">If you do nothing but wear a mask when appropriate and practice good hand hygiene, for most people, that's most of the PPE battle. But in addition to this, it makes sense to wear gloves when taking out the trash, as that involves touching objects like doorknobs and trash receptacle lids that are especially likely to pass on disease-causing microbes because many people touch them. Wearing gloves also makes sense when caring for someone who is ill. Gowns, caps, and eye protection probably only make sense for healthcare workers and people caring for someone with COVID-19 at home. Healthcare workers and others with particularly high exposures may even need to take additional PPE precautions where possible, like double-gowning, because worse initial exposures may be associated with worse disease outcomes (maybe by causing higher starting viral loads that then grow exponentially). </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How to fit it properly</span>

<span style="color:green;">Much PPE is one-size-fits all (such as caps) or sized in categories like small, medium, and large (such as gloves and gowns). Respirators are the hardest piece of PPE to fit. Take the time to look up some [videos on how to](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+fit+a+respirator+mask) properly mold one to your face with your fingers, covering your nose and cheekbones closely. Don't squeeze the bridge. Mask and respirator fit are especially important for keeping potentially dangerous particulate out (in the case of going out in public or taking care of patients) or in (in case you are ill, or an asymptomatic carrier). </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How to safely don and doff it</span>

<span style="color:green;">To put it on: Create a clean zone (other than wearing your &quot;dirty&quot; / patient care / outside clothes) before donning PPE. Wash your hands first, then put on your mask, and keep your hands off your mask while you're wearing it. Then put on your gown and any other protective equipment -- while keeping it &quot;clean.&quot; This means, for example, ripping the gown's back-of-the-neck fastening so that you can put your arms into it without putting it over your head (to avoid smearing the gown against the mask). Always maintain good hand hygiene while wearing PPE. </span>

<span style="color:green;">To take it off: First remove your gloves and wash your hands. Then remove your gown and wash your hands again. Then remove any remaining PPE and wash your hands again. Then remove your &quot;dirty&quot; clothes and wash your hands again. Then put on your &quot;clean&quot; clothes and proceed to a zone you know is &quot;clean.&quot; </span>

<span style="color:green;">#### How to disinfect or dispose of it after use</span>

<span style="color:green;">If you are disposing of PPE after use, you will want to place it in a disposable trash bag. Some municipalities recommend double-bagging that bag / any possibly contaminated waste. Then place the trash aside for 72 hours before external disposal in a communal area or trash bin. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Under normal circumstances, most PPE is considered disposal, i.e., intended to be thrown away after one use. But a global pandemic with shortages in many countries of critical equipment including respirators / masks for healthcare workers and others, does not present a normal set of circumstances. Now is a time to use what you have to the fullest. That means disinfecting rather than disposing of PPE whenever possible. </span>

<span style="color:green;">The best way to reuse PPE during this pandemic is probably to mark seven masks or sets of PPE -- one for each day of the week. Rotate them after wearing to sit in a clean place for a week. The virus should be dead after that period of time. There do not presently seem to be shortages of other PPE, but the same rotation decontamination strategy would apply. Alternately, if you need the mask(s) / respirator(s) decontaminated faster, bake them in the oven at 70° Celsius (around 160° Farenheit) for 30 minutes. For hard surfaces like face shields and goggles, normal disinfectant solutions like Windex should kill the virus. For soft surfaces like cotton masks, spraying or soaking with alcohol or diluted hydrogen peroxide should do the trick. It seems likely, however, that using heat, chemicals, or other, faster potential decontamination techniques will result in worse overall wear and tear on the PPE than rotating a weekly set in and out of a clean place. Less wear and tear means better-protecting PPE.</span> 

* **Medical mask, preferably N95** (a few EUR/USD)
   &gt; <span style="color:red;">![](/images/mask.png)</span><span style="color:green;">![](/assets/images/mask.png)</span>
   &gt; 
   &gt; FFP2 or FFP3 respirators are also recommended. A regular face mask (surgical or procedural) is better than nothing if you cannot get a respirator. Note that the respirators come in version with and without a valve. The valve (often a round plastic thingy) lets out the exhaled air unfiltered. This is fine if you're spraypainting, and it may be fine if you are protecting a known healthy person from a known sick person, but under no circumstances should the sick wear a version with a valve. 

<span style="color:green;">* **Face mask, hand-made** (20 EUR/USD for fabric, check if you need other supplies)</span>
<span style="color:green;">   &gt; ![](/assets/images/mask-template.png)</span>
<span style="color:green;">   &gt; </span>
<span style="color:green;">   &gt; Maybe you cannot find an N95, FFP2, FFP3, or regular medical mask for purchase at the moment. Hopefully that situation will not last, because everyone will have adequate PPE soon. But who knows? Just do something. You can still make your own mask using our [mask-making template](https://covid-at-home.info/facemask). Or wrap a scarf around your nose and mouth as needed. Something is better than nothing. </span>

<span style="color:green;">* **Gloves** (less than a EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7))</span>
<span style="color:green;">   &gt; ![](/assets/images/gloves.png)</span>

* **Gown / raincoat** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFDFFRX))

   &gt; Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown. 

<span style="color:red;">* **Gloves** (less than a EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7))</span>
<span style="color:red;">   &gt; ![](/images/gloves.png)</span>

* **Eye protection, goggles or face shield** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002THV25Y))
