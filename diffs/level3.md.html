## Level 3 -- Bedridden

All the good care in Level 2 has not worked and things are getting worse. Doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just keep going. Except <span style="color:red;">now the patient is</span><span style="color:green;">you're</span> getting <span style="color:red;">weaker. He or she is often too weak</span><span style="color:green;">weaker, and you're not just coughing anymore, but you feel like absolute crap (doctors call that &quot;general malaise&quot;), things hurt, and you want</span> to <span style="color:red;">get out of</span><span style="color:green;">be in</span> bed <span style="color:red;">and may need extra encouragement</span><span style="color:green;">most of the time. It's easy to forget</span> to eat and drink.

<span style="color:red;">### If the patient is you</span><span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.begin }}</span>

<span style="color:red;">This is when you start telling other people around you</span><span style="color:green;">Now</span> that you are really <span style="color:red;">ill and are mostly in bed. Talk</span><span style="color:green;">getting ill, it's time</span> to <span style="color:red;">someone</span><span style="color:green;">let your regular General Practitioner / doctor / primary care physician know if</span> you <span style="color:red;">trust about how they</span><span style="color:green;">haven't spoken to him/her already earlier. The doctor</span> may <span style="color:green;">do house visits or</span> have <span style="color:green;">a protocol</span> to <span style="color:red;">take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If</span><span style="color:green;">assess</span> you <span style="color:red;">have people in your environment who have already had COVID-19 (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make</span><span style="color:green;">over</span> the <span style="color:red;">best caregivers as they presumably will</span><span style="color:green;">phone or via videochat. There may</span> be <span style="color:red;">COVID-19-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in</span><span style="color:green;">additional advice or guidelines</span> your <span style="color:red;">circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because if the disease progresses, you</span><span style="color:green;">doctor</span> will <span style="color:red;">get short of breath which inevitably will also affect your ability to talk</span><span style="color:green;">give you. Doctors know their patients</span> and <span style="color:green;">can tailor advice</span> to <span style="color:red;">think clearly.</span><span style="color:green;">the case at hand. So follow any advice, also if it contradicts any of the more general advice given here.</span>

<span style="color:red;">![](/images/sick-in-bed.png)</span><span style="color:green;">Ask the doctor or otherwise try to use reliable local information to see what, if anything, is expected of people with worsening symptoms where you are. The health authorities may have a website, app, or other mechanism to register a worsening of symptoms. This could be important for keeping an eye on the pandemic, but also to figure out who needs additional care.</span>

<span style="color:red;">### In any case</span><span style="color:green;">If you have no primary care doctor, you will need to seek up-to-date local information on what help is available to you. If all lines everywhere are busy -- which is certainly a possibility during the peaks of this crisis -- do not panic, just keep trying.</span>

<span style="color:red;">* Stay in bed. At this point rest is very important. The patient should sleep as much as possible. At least in the beginning, patients will still be able to get out of bed for limited amounts of time. Toilet, a quick rinse-off shower, weighing once a day (note in [diary](/images/covid-diary.pdf)). Put new sheets on the bed as often as possible and wash the old sheets at 60 degrees Celsius or warmer.</span>
<span style="color:red;">* Ventilate the room as often as possible.</span>
<span style="color:red;">* Drink more water! (more than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day).</span>
<span style="color:red;">* Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok.</span>
<span style="color:red;">* Inhale more often.</span><span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.end }}</span>

<span style="color:red;">At this point, read ahead for all the signs</span><span style="color:green;">### Now</span> that<span style="color:red;">indicate Level 4. The purpose of care in Level 3 is also to monitor the patient more and more closely so as to catch early any signs that the patient is moving to Level 4. For instance: If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day,</span> you <span style="color:red;">should (kindly) insist. Dehydration is a medical condition, and without this daily bare minimum you're quickly in Level 4.</span><span style="color:green;">are sick</span>

<span style="color:green;">* Rest. At this point, rest is very important. Sleep as much as possible. At least in the beginning, you will still be able to get out of bed for limited amounts of time. Toilet, a quick rinse-off shower, weighing once a day (note in [diary](/images/covid-diary.pdf)). Put new sheets on the bed when you can, and make sure the old sheets are washed at 60° Celsius (140° Farenheit) or warmer.</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Get fresh air. Ventilate the room as often as possible. </span>
<span style="color:green;">* Drink more water! More than 2 liters and less then 5 liters a day, or at least 8.5 cups. Remember your body needs more fluids than usual when you're sweating from a fever.</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Eat something. Try to eat vitamin-rich foods, but multi-vitamin drink is also ok.</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Use those lungs. See the Level 2 advice on breathing deeply in and out, moving your arms above your head to help your chest fully expand, and even exercising your lung capacity if possible by blowing up a balloon or using another toy that requires blowing every hour.</span>

<span style="color:green;">### A typical day</span>

<span style="color:green;">At this stage, a typical day might look something like this: </span>

<span style="color:green;">You get up, weigh, and note weight in illness diary. You might also want to take your temperature first thing, before eating or drinking, especially if you are taking temperature orally -- and note it in the illness diary, too. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Then, start drinking fluids. Not too much caffeine or sugar. As much water and herbal tea as you like. Remember you want to drink at least 2 liters (around 8.5 cups) and up to 5 liters a day. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Air out your home as much as possible, perhaps while the water for your morning tea or coffee is boiling.  If you have the energy (and enough sheets), consider changing your bed linens if they got sweaty / otherwise soiled. Next, have a quick shower if you're able. Staying clean can help you feel better mentally and emotionally, as well as physically. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Eat a small, nutritious meal (piece of fresh fruit? handful of salted nuts?) -- something that sounds good to you. This is also a good time to take paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) for fever / pain if you really need it, and note the dose and time in your illness diary.</span>

<span style="color:green;">If that was already enough exertion, take a rest. Nap whenever you can -- sleep is crucial for healing. If you're not sleepy but need to rest, then try to rest sitting up to give your lungs a better chance to drain. If you're still upright, now is a good time to steam to help your sinuses / airways open and mucus to drain. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Speaking of being upright, remember to ventilate your room and breathe in the fresh air. Lift your arms over your head to fully expand your lungs on the inhale. Try blowing up a balloon to fully exhale. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Keep drinking throughout the day. Some people find it helpful to empty and refill a liter bottle of water or a teapot that holds approximately a liter, so that it's easier to keep track of roughly how much you have drunk. This also makes it easier to keep water by the sofa or bed while you are resting. </span>

<span style="color:green;">Throughout the day, check in with yourself about fatigue (sleep as much as possible), hunger (eat small, nutritious meals), thirst (drink whenever you feel like it), and temperature (take care to keep warm enough). If you feel up to it, and only if you feel up to it, move your body (e.g., go for a short walk as long as it's still permitted where you are, or get up and dance to a favorite song). </span>

<span style="color:green;">Finally, you want to be alert to signs that your condition may be worsening and you may need more care. So after taking basic care of yourself, then check in with other people around you who know that you are really ill. Let them know how you are doing -- and if you need help, ask. Especially let someone know if you start experiencing more severe symptoms (see the next section).</span>

<span style="color:green;">### The fork in the road</span>

<span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.begin }}</span>

<span style="color:green;">Current guidance in many places is that COVID-19 patients who cannot take care of themselves (anymore) are treated elsewhere. Given that the patient's condition can worsen quickly, there are good reasons to be cared for by medically trained professionals who can keep an eye on you -- while (hopefully) having adequate protection and training to not get infected themselves. Letting the experts do it instead of staying home also protects your loved ones from infection. </span>

<span style="color:green;">We are seeing this break down in places where there are a lot of cases, with some very ill patients deemed &quot;not sick enough&quot; to go to the hospital, and no other sorts of centralized quarantine facilities with medical staff (yet?) available. This text will continue assuming the COVID-19 patient needs to be cared for at home. This is not the optimal situation. If possible, you should consult with a doctor when you feel you need help before risking anyone becoming infected while they take care of you.</span>

<span style="color:green;">{{ site.breakout.end }}</span>

<span style="color:green;">Tell other people around you that you are really ill and are mostly in bed. Talk to someone you trust about how they may have to take care of you. Have this person or these people read this document. If you have people in your environment who have already had COVID-19 (something that will be increasingly common as time goes on), such people would naturally make the best caregivers as they presumably will be (at least partially) COVID-19-immune. Otherwise try to judge what is wisest in your circumstances. By all means do not wait with this until the very last moment, because if the disease progresses, you will get short of breath -- which inevitably will also affect your ability to talk and think clearly. Everyone at this level, especially patients who live alone, should really have someone checking on them regularly, because the deterioration in respiratory function can be very fast, especially in the second week. </span>

<span style="color:green;">[](/images/sick-in-bed.png)</span>

<span style="color:green;">### Others taking care of you</span>

<span style="color:green;">If non-medical people are going to need to take care of you (or if you need to take care of someone who is ill), make sure adequate protection is used to the extent possible. At this point, patient and caregiver need to be closer together, so use all the protection you can have: raincoat, protective glasses / face shield, gloves. Train the proper procedures for putting these on and taking them off, going through that in your head over and over again.</span>

<span style="color:green;">From now on in this text, we will assume that you're the caregiver. Read ahead for signs that indicate Level 4. The purpose of care in Level 3 is also to monitor the patient more and more closely so as to catch early any signs that the patient urgently needs expert medical care. For instance: If the patient is not able to drink at least 2 liters of fluids per day, you should (kindly) insist. Dehydration is a medical condition, and without a daily minimum, you're quickly in Level 4.</span>

In most cases, however, the patient will improve after a few days or at most a week. Just stay with it. Once the patient gets a little better, care may be done by the patient him- or herself again. <span style="color:green;">Don't be in contact any more than you have to, minimise the risk of becoming infected whereever possible.</span> Make sure the illness diary <span style="color:green;">is kept until all symptoms are gone,</span> and quarantine <span style="color:red;">are</span><span style="color:green;">is</span> kept up until the patient has been <span style="color:red;">completely well</span><span style="color:green;">symptom-free</span> for <span style="color:red;">a while.</span><span style="color:green;">14 days.</span> If you have been caring for the patient, <span style="color:red;">your</span><span style="color:green;">self-isolate again. Your</span> own two-week self-quarantine period now begins.

### Care work

A large part of the work you are doing at this stage is care work, which may overlap with nursing but does not require specialized training. Remember that people who need help with basic self-care due to illness may be embarrassed to ask for or accept it. Be gracious. Everyone needs help sometimes. Think how to make the patient physically, mentally, and emotionally more comfortable and well; you might do this by asking yourself what you would need in their position, by watching for cues <span style="color:red;">about</span><span style="color:green;">that may indicate</span> discomfort (e.g., shivering, sweating), or by asking how you can help. 

Some possibly useful behaviors include:
* Getting at eye level and at a distance that is large enough for comfort but small enough that they do not have to strain speaking loudly to talk to you. <span style="color:green;">At the same time, try to put some distance between you and the patient where possible to prevent infection.</span>
* Simple encouragement to drink and eat. <span style="color:red;">(E.g.,</span><span style="color:green;">E.g.,</span> &quot;Drink, <span style="color:red;">honey.&quot;)</span><span style="color:green;">honey.&quot;</span> 
* If the patient is not drinking or eating adequately, offer alternatives. <span style="color:red;">(E.g.,</span><span style="color:green;">E.g.,</span> if solid food is unappealing, what about soup, bouillon, or electrolyte solution? If hot drinks are unappealing, what about something cold, or <span style="color:red;">vice-versa?)</span><span style="color:green;">vice-versa? If the patient can't feed himself / herself, could you spoon-feed him / her?</span> 
* Checking that the patient is warm enough in the extremities (e.g., cold feet?) and at night.
* <span style="color:green;">Setting up a fan to blow air in the patient's face can relax patients who are feeling breathless. Helping the patient breathe in a fresh breeze from an open window if possible can have the same effect. </span>
<span style="color:green;">*</span> Reassure the patient that it is <span style="color:green;">very</span> likely that he or she will make a full <span style="color:red;">recovery.</span><span style="color:green;">recovery (which is true). Offer relaxation techniques (soothing music, humor, counting breaths).</span> 
* If breathing is labored, try breathing techniques (e.g., pursed lips or diaphragmatic breathing techniques) and positional changes (e.g., leaning your chest forward a little or putting your arms and head down on a table while sitting with feet flat on the floor; or sleeping on your side with a pillow between your knees, or on your back with your head elevated with a pillow or two). 
* Keeping the illness diary (see below).


### Illness diary

As mentioned in the previous section, you might want to use this [printable form](/images/covid-diary.pdf), or make your own. 

At this stage, <span style="color:green;">measure the vital signs often, log them in the illness diary, and</span> watch out especially for and note symptoms that might suggest worsening. Read the next section for more detail, but these include dizziness or rapid heart rate (drink more and eat something if you can), rapid breathing (elevate head while lying down or lower it to the table while sitting up for easier breathing), and a blue tint to fingertips or lips (cyanosis <span style="color:red;">-</span><span style="color:green;">--</span> get fresh air, get warm, and check blood oxygenation if possible).<span style="color:red;">Also consider using relaxation techniques to slow a rapid respiration or heart rate that may be partially due to anxiety: Listen to soothing music, check in with a friend electronically, or see if you can slow your breathing and bring down your heart rate by counting longer for forceful exhaling than for gentle inhaling. (Some people use 4-7-8 and others prefer 5-2-5 to try slowing down their inhale-hold-exhale patterns.)</span> 

If you think the patient's condition might be worsening, your illness diary might expand to include the following: 
- more frequent temperature readings
- respiration rate (breaths per minute)
- heart rate
- onset of new confusion <span style="color:green;">(if the person seems to have less mental capacity than normal)</span>

If the patient's condition seems to be worsening, skip to the next section. 

### <span style="color:red;">A typical day</span>

<span style="color:red;">At this stage, a typical day might look something like this: </span>

<span style="color:red;">You (or</span><span style="color:green;">Go bag</span>

<span style="color:green;">If your condition deteriorates to</span> the <span style="color:red;">patient) get up, weigh, and note weight in illness diary. You might also want</span><span style="color:green;">point that you / the patient needs</span> to <span style="color:red;">take your temperature first thing, before eating</span><span style="color:green;">go to hospital, **you will not have time</span> or <span style="color:red;">drinking, especially if you are taking temperature orally - and note it</span><span style="color:green;">be</span> in the <span style="color:red;">illness diary, too. </span>

<span style="color:red;">Then, start drinking fluids. Not too much caffeine or sugar. As much water and herbal tea as you like. Remember you want</span><span style="color:green;">mood</span> to <span style="color:red;">drink at least 2 liters and up</span><span style="color:green;">think about what</span> to <span style="color:red;">5 liters</span><span style="color:green;">pack**. So prepare beforehand</span> a <span style="color:red;">day. </span>

<span style="color:red;">Air out your home as much as possible, perhaps while the water for your morning tea or coffee is boiling.  If you have the energy (and enough sheets), consider changing your bed linens if they got sweaty / otherwise soiled. Next, have</span><span style="color:green;">small bag with</span> a <span style="color:red;">quick shower if you're able. Staying clean can help you feel better mentally</span><span style="color:green;">zipper / firm closure that contains:</span>
<span style="color:green;">* A piece of paper with, in clearly readable print:</span>
<span style="color:green;">  * Identifying information: Name, date of birth, address</span>
<span style="color:green;">  * Names, addresses,</span> and <span style="color:red;">emotionally, as well as physically. </span>

<span style="color:red;">Eat a small, nutritious meal (piece</span><span style="color:green;">telephone numbers</span> of <span style="color:red;">fresh fruit? handful</span><span style="color:green;">loved ones and next of kin</span>
<span style="color:green;">  * ( optional: pincode to patient's cell phone )</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Government-issued ID, or a copy</span> of<span style="color:red;">salted nuts?) - something</span> that
<span style="color:red;">sounds good to you. This</span><span style="color:green;">* Health-ID card, health insurance card, whatever</span> is <span style="color:red;">also a good time to take paracetamol</span><span style="color:green;">applicable where you are</span>
<span style="color:green;">* A set or two of simple and compact fresh clothes</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Bath slippers</span> (also known as <span style="color:red;">acetaminophen) for fever / pain</span><span style="color:green;">flip-flops)</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Spare glasses if available</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Toothbrush, toothpaste</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Patient's living will document, if applicable</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Phone charger</span> if you <span style="color:red;">need it, and note</span><span style="color:green;">have an extra</span>
<span style="color:green;">* USB battery pack if you have one</span>
<span style="color:green;">* Previous days of</span> the <span style="color:red;">dose and time in your</span><span style="color:green;">patient</span> illness <span style="color:red;">diary. </span>

<span style="color:red;">If that was already enough exertion, take a rest. Nap whenever you can - sleep is crucial for healing. If you're not sleepy but need to rest, then try to rest sitting up to give your lungs a better chance to drain. If you're still upright, now is a good time to steam to help your sinuses / airways open and mucus</span><span style="color:green;">diary</span>

<span style="color:green;">It would be ideal</span> to <span style="color:red;">drain. </span>

<span style="color:red;">Keep drinking throughout</span><span style="color:green;">have</span> the <span style="color:red;">day. Some people find it helpful to empty</span><span style="color:green;">patient name</span> and <span style="color:red;">refill a liter bottle</span><span style="color:green;">date</span> of <span style="color:red;">water or a teapot that holds approximately a liter, so that it's easier to keep track of roughly how much you have drunk. This also makes it easier to keep water by</span><span style="color:green;">birth readable on</span> the <span style="color:red;">sofa or bed while you are resting. </span>

<span style="color:red;">Throughout</span><span style="color:green;">outside of</span> the <span style="color:red;">day, check in with yourself about fatigue (sleep</span><span style="color:green;">bag</span> as <span style="color:red;">much as possible), hunger (eat small, nutritious meals), thirst (drink whenever you feel like it), and temperature (take care to keep warm enough). If you feel up</span><span style="color:green;">well.</span>

<span style="color:green;">When it is time</span> to <span style="color:red;">it, and only if you feel up</span><span style="color:green;">go, remember</span> to <span style="color:red;">it, move (e.g., go for a short walk as long as it's still permitted where you are, or get up</span><span style="color:green;">put glasses, phone, charger,</span> and <span style="color:red;">dance to a favorite song). </span>

<span style="color:red;">Finally,</span><span style="color:green;">today's page of the illness diary in the bag before</span> you <span style="color:red;">want to be alert to signs</span><span style="color:green;">go. Remember</span> that <span style="color:red;">your condition may</span><span style="color:green;">there will likely</span> be <span style="color:red;">worsening</span><span style="color:green;">no visits allowed in hospitals during peak pandemic phases,</span> and <span style="color:red;">you</span><span style="color:green;">COVID-19 patients (and others)</span> may <span style="color:red;">need more care. So after taking basic care of yourself, then check</span><span style="color:green;">be</span> in <span style="color:green;">far-away makeshift hospitals or quarantine facilities staffed</span> with <span style="color:red;">other people around you who know that you are really ill. Let them know how you are doing - and if you need help, ask. Especially let someone know if you start experiencing more severe symptoms (see the next section).</span><span style="color:green;">medical professionals.</span>
